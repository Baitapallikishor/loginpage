   <p>The PPP stands for Point-to-Point protocol. It is the most commonly used protocol for point-to-point access. Suppose the user wants to access the internet from the home, the PPP protocol will be used.

    It is a data link layer protocol that resides in the layer 2 of the OSI model. It is used to encapsulate the layer 3 protocols and all the information available in the payload in order to be transmitted across the serial links. The PPP protocol can be used on synchronous link like ISDN as well as asynchronous link like dial-up. It is mainly used for the communication between the two devices.
    
    It can be used over many types of physical networks such as serial cable, phone line, trunk line, cellular telephone, fiber optic links such as SONET. As the data link layer protocol is used to identify from where the transmission starts and ends, so ISP (Internet Service Provider) use the PPP protocol to provide the dial-up access to the internet.</p>
